# Team Name: The Super Idol Enthusiasts

# Objective
We believe that the college board website is too bland and uninteractive so we will make our own website to teach you about the collegeboard topics that you will need you will need to know in order to pass the test.

10 Essential Technicals (and one possible technical) that we will be working on over the course of the trimester will be the following:
* Addition of Collegeboard topics using HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Deployment using AWS
* Creation of a Collegeboard mock quiz using APIS
* Implementation of CSS for user input
* A score-saver that keeps track of CB quiz scores over time
* Sidebar where one can annotate (notepad that one can save)
* An API that allows the user to compare CB exams from different years
* Study tools that one can click on and buy from our website (mock register + purchase)
* Study tips + score frequency
* API that allows the user to compare responses to MCQs and past projects
* (POSSIBLE TECHNICAL) A development environment where students can type in and test code
